*After reading this page you will have built your very own OpenAI ChatGPT ChatBot, while at the same time learning all the tools to help you on the road to becoming an AI Python Programmer. So, welcome again to the page and do not worry about not knowing the technical jargon used, it will also be explained a bit easier also with English that you will understand. My hope is that by having both languages here your gap in knowledge will get smaller, as technical language can be imitating sometimes and stops us from learning. Read the technical language as it is perfect! And then read the student language to link them together.*

Each topic has [code blocks](#code_blocks) that can be used in projects

As OpenAi is a chatbot that can answer so many different questions, this script by the end will be a working chatbot using OpenAI API and you an use different [OpenAI Models](#OpenAI_Models) like GPT-4-TURBO, GPT-4 and GPT-4o and so many more. The script will get bigger due to having code in the script for the other code to work.

1. The chatbot will save your conversation in [json](#json) and text format with timestamps in case you want to use them to train your own AI Agent.
2. You will be able to upload your own files and chat to them by creating a [vector database](#vector_database) on OpenAI's server.
3. The script will have an error.log to show any internal errors when the script is running.
4. You will be able to chat with your chatbot on the terminal for as long as you want until you run out of credit!
