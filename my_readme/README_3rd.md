# Welcome to the OpenAI Python API library.

&nbsp;

The [OpenAI](#openai) [Python](#python) [library](#library) provides convenient access to the OpenAI [REST API](#rest-api) from any Python 3.7+ application. The library includes type definitions for all request [params](#parameters) and response fields, and offers both [synchronous](#synchronous) and [asynchronous](#asynchronous) clients powered by [httpx](#http). It is generated from our [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/openai/openai-openapi) with [Stainless](https://stainlessapi.com/).

The OpenAI Python library is like a toolbox that makes it easy to use OpenAI's AI models in your Python programs. Imagine you have a smart robot assistant that can help you with various tasks like answering questions or generating text. This library helps you communicate with that robot using a set of rules (API) over the internet.

*After reading this page you will have built your very own OpenAI ChatGPT ChatBot, while at the same time learning all the tools to help you on the road to becomming an AI Python Programmer. So, welcome again to the page and do not worry about not knowing the technical jaron used, it will also be explained a bit easier also with English that you will understand. My hope is that by having both languages here your gap in knowledge will get smaller, as technical language can be imtidating sometimes and stops us from learning. Read the technical language as it is perfect! And then read the student language to link them together.*

Good luck and enjoy the journey!

## Documentation

The OpenAI documentation is like a user manual for this system. It has all the instructions and information you need to use OpenAI's AI models in your Python programs. Think of it as a detailed guide that shows you how to communicate with your smart robot assistant.

The documentation in this README.md file will teach you how to use the tools provided by OpenAI to be able to then use them with your own project.

There are full instructions written for the professional using technical language, and for the new student we will use the English language to explain things.

The words in Blue are there to help the new students learn the technical words, and there is a "Quick Definitions" section at the end of this document to explain the technical term as this helps to understand and learn faster.

To make things easier for the student. The instructions for each option OpenAI has for coding will also have a script to use. This will help you to learn and use the code right away without having to spend time looking for answers on where to add the block of code in your script. I had this problem myself when I was learning how to use OpenAI and how to use ChatGPT on my own computer using Python. At the time I didn't know what python was! Now I do.

Each topic has code blocks that can be used in projects, and I had no idea what they were and how to even use them. This is when I started to read the manual and I didn't understand anything as I am new to programming, then I thought of other people expecially those who want to learn but can't understand how to use the code, or even how to ask the question. I was like this myself. So the instruction on each topic will have the block of code on it's own, and then there will be a second script that has the code inside it and you can copy and paste the code into a python file and run the file and see the outcome right away.

As OpenAi is a chatbot that can answer so many different questions, this script by the end will be a working chatbot using OpenAI API and you an use different OpenAI models like GPT-4-TURBO, GPT-4 and GPT-4o and so many more. The script will get bigger due to having code in the script for the other code to work.

1. The chatbot will save your conversation in json and text format with timestamps in case you want to use them to train your own AI Agent.
2. You will be able to upload your own files and chat to them by creating a vector database on OpenAI's server.
3. The script will have an error.log to show any internal errors when the script is running.
4. You will be able to chat with your chatbot on the terminal for as long as you want until you run out of credit!

The **[REST API](#rest-api) documentation can be found on** **[platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/docs). The full API of this** **[library](#library) can be found in** [api.md](api.md).

## Installation

<p align="center">

</p>

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The [SDK](#sdk) was rewritten in v1, which was released November 6th 2023. See the **[**v1 migration guide**]** ( **https://github.com/openai/openai-python/discussions/742**), which includes scripts to automatically update your code.

#### Requirements

The requirements to use Openai is that you are using Python 3.7 version or higher, and some sort of computer.

##### **How to install python on your system, follow these steps:**

[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=python)](https://github.com/davidtkeane)[![Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/linux-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=Linux)](https://github.com/davidtkeane)[![Windows](https://img.shields.io/badge/Windows-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=Tower)](https://github.com/davidtkeane)[![Apple](https://img.shields.io/badge/AppleMac-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=Apple)](https://github.com/davidtkeane)

You need Python 3.7 or higher to use this library. It's like needing a specific version of an app to use certain features. Make sure your Python version is up to date before trying to use this library.

###### For Windows:

1. **Download Installer**: Go to the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest installer.
2. **Run Installer**: Run the downloaded file. Check the box for "Add Python to PATH" and click "Install Now."
3. **Verify Installation**: Open Command Prompt and type `python --version` to check the installed version.
   ```
   python --version
   ```

###### For macOS:

1. **Use Homebrew**: Open Terminal and install Homebrew if you haven't:
   ```
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```
2. **Install Python**: Run:
   ```
   brew update
   brew upgrade
   brew install python
   ```

###### For Linux:

1. **Use Package Manager**: For Ubuntu, open Terminal and run.
   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3
   ```

###### Verification

To verify the installation, type `python --version` in the terminal or command prompt. This should display the installed Python version.

To check your Python version, you can open a terminal or command prompt and type:

```python
python --version
```

If your version is lower than 3.7, you'll need to update Python to use this library. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

##### 🚀 **Explanation:**

To use this library, you need to install it first. This is like installing a new app on your phone, but for Python. Imagine you are adding a new tool to your toolbox so you can use it in your programming projects. The command `pip install openai` is like telling your computer to go to the Python app store (PyPI) and download the OpenAI tool for you. To use the .env file we will need a module called python-dotenv and it will need to be installed as this package allows you to load environment variables from a  `.env` file into your environment, which is useful for keeping sensitive information like API keys out of your codebase.

```python
pip install openai
pip install python-dotenv
```

### How to obtain your OpenAi API Key.

To obtain an OpenAI API key, follow these steps:

1. **Sign Up**: Go to the [OpenAI website](https://www.openai.com/) and sign up for an account if you don't already have one.
2. **Login**: Once logged in, navigate to the API section.
3. **Generate Key**: Click on "API keys" and then "Create API Key." A new key will be generated and displayed.
4. **Save the Key**: Copy and securely store the API key. You will use this key to authenticate your requests to the OpenAI API.

For more details, visit the [OpenAI API documentation](https://beta.openai.com/docs/).

## Usage

### How to use the OpenAI code in a python script.

The full API of this library can be found in [api.md](api.md).

While you can provide an `api_key` keyword argument, we recommend using [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) to be able to use OpenAi API Key.

1. Open the .env and place you key after the = sign.
2. `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-putyourkeyhere > replace `sk-putyourkeyhere
3. Save the file.
4. You can now use the API key in your script by adding from `dotenv import load_dotenv`
5. To load environment variables (your API Key ) from .env file into your script you will need to add `load_dotenv()`into the script. See below for an example.
6. Copy the code below and save it as test_openai.py
7. Then inside the terminal type `python test_openai.py`

```python
import os
from openai import OpenAI
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables (loads your API Key) from .env file
load_dotenv()

# Initialize OpenAI client
client = OpenAI(
    api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
)

chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Say this is a test",
        }
    ],
    model="gpt-4o",
)

print(chat_completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

```
> python test_openai.py
This is a test.

This is what you should see afterwards.
This means that you are on the right path and connected your script to the ChatGPT
and using the GPT-4o Model using openai and dotenv modules. Congratulations!
```

##### 💡 **Explanation:**

Here's how you use the library to talk to the AI models. Think of this like having a conversation with your smart robot assistant. You set up the connection, ask it to say something, and then it responds. Let's break it down:

1. First, you import the necessary tools (`os` and `OpenAI`).
2. Then, you create a "client" - think of this as establishing a phone line to the AI.
3. You send a message to the AI, just like texting a friend.
4. The AI processes your message and sends back a response.

This code sets up the AI client and asks it to say "This is a test." It's like teaching a parrot to repeat a phrase!

### Polling Helpers

When interacting with the API some actions such as starting a [Run](#run) and adding files to vector stores are [asynchronous](#asynchronous) and take time to complete. The SDK includes helper functions which will poll the status until it reaches a terminal state and then return the resulting object. If an API method results in an action that could benefit from polling there will be a corresponding version of the method ending in '_and_poll'.

##### ⏳ **Explanation:**

Some actions take time to complete, like starting a process or uploading files. Polling helpers keep checking until these actions are done. Imagine you are baking a cake and you keep checking the oven until the cake is ready. In this case, you're starting a task (like asking the AI to do some work) and then waiting until it's finished before moving on. The `create_and_poll` function does this waiting for you automatically, so you don't have to keep checking manually.

#### Running a Thread

To create and poll a run within a thread using the OpenAI API, follow these steps:

#### Overview

The following example demonstrates how to initiate a run within a specific thread and automatically poll for its status. This can be useful for tracking the progress of a long-running task, such as a conversation or a job.

#### Example Code

```python
# Assuming you have already set up the OpenAI client and have a thread and assistant
run = client.beta.threads.runs.create_and_poll(
    thread_id=thread.id,
    assistant_id=assistant.id,
)
```

* `thread_id`: The unique identifier for the thread in which you want to run the task. This is essential to specify the context of the run.
* `assistant_id`: The unique identifier for the assistant you want to use. This could be an AI model or a specific assistant configuration.
* The script below will use the code and create the identifiers once the script has ran. Copy these to the .env file afterwards. More info below.
* More information on the lifecycle of a Run can be found in the [Run Lifecycle Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/how-it-works/run-lifecycle)

#### Usage

1. **Setup** : Make sure you have the necessary API credentials and have initialized the OpenAI client properly.
2. **Run Creation** : Use the  `create_and_poll` method to start a new run within the specified thread.
3. **Polling** : The function automatically polls the run's status, providing updates until the task is complete.

#### Example of Code using Polling Helpers

1. Create a file called chat.py
2. Copy and Paste the code below into the file, make sure the file is in the same folder as the .env file.
3. Best make a new folder for this page and make seperate files for each script. This is handy to see the differences and learn.
4. Make sure you have your .env file with OPENAI_API_KEY=yourkey
5. ```
   python chat.py
   ```

1. This is the return response from using the command `python chat.py`
2. I am using 'p'. This is an aliases I created to save time typing python every time, add this to the .bashrc or .zshrc alises file wihtout the brackers (aliases p="python ")
3. This code will create the Thread ID, Run ID and Assistant ID.

#### Bulk Upload Helpers

You can upload your documents and the script will be able to answer questions on the documents you uploaded.

When creating and interacting with vector stores, you can use polling helpers to monitor the status of operations.
For convenience, we also provide a bulk upload helper to allow you to simultaneously upload several files at once.

For more information about what kind of files can be uploaded and more code, please go to [https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/file-search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/file-search)

##### 📤 **Explanation:**

You can upload multiple files at once and check their status. This is like sending a bunch of letters at the post office and waiting to see when they are all delivered. In programming terms, you're sending multiple files to the AI system at the same time, which can save a lot of time compared to uploading them one by one. The `upload_and_poll` function takes care of sending all the files and waiting until they're all properly received and processed.

```python
sample_files = [Path("sample-paper.pdf"), ...]

batch = await client.vector_stores.file_batches.upload_and_poll(
    store.id,
    files=sample_files,
)
```

For convenience,

1. I have expanded the first script and added each new option into the same script so you can see where the code is being used.
   a. I have added the ability to save the conversations to a .txt file and .json files, in case at a later stage you wish to train your own model using your own chat files.
   b. I added temperature, max_tokens and other settings to help get the best assistant as possible.
   c. The script has file upload and multiple file upload, and make a vector store to break up the files into chunks to be able to understand them better.
   d. Added the option to create and poll a run within a thread using the OpenAI API (Thread_ID and Assistant_ID)

   ```
   # This is the code which can be altered that shows the settings that can chage the output of your request.

          response = client.chat.completions.create(
               model=model_engine,
               messages=[
                   {"role": "system", "content": assistant_role},
                   {"role": "user", "content": query}
               ],
               temperature=0.9,
               max_tokens=2048,
               top_p=1,
               frequency_penalty=0,
               presence_penalty=0.1,
               stop=[" Human:", " AI:"]
           )
   ```
2. Create a file called chat.py, or use a different name if you have saved each script as we go along (This might be better).
3. If you can copy both thread_id and assistant_id from the last run of chat.py and enter them into the .env file below OPENAI_API_KEY

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-maybeishoulduseperplexity
   THREAD_ID=thread_jQZNE3hs968JWWZAPiB2Tk2C
   ASSISTANT_ID=asst_vnInhkMyxNkcON1UZpJylQN8
   ```
4. Copy and Paste the python code below into the file like chat.py, and make sure the file is in the same folder as the .env file.
5. Now next step is to run the script.
6. ```
   python chat.py

1. After running the file you should get something like this below. Again (p is my aliases for the word python).
2. When Jervis asks 'How can I help?" You can either ask a question or type upload and it will ask you for the files location. I usually right click on a file and click the copy path and use that (I am using a Macbook Pro M3).

![1722374227549](images/README/1722374227549.png)

To ask questions about a file you've uploaded, you need to ensure that the file is part of a vector store that the assistant can query. The vector store is a conceptual database where the content of your files is indexed and can be searched. Here's how you can modify the script to handle file uploads, create a vector store, and allow you to ask questions about the uploaded files:

**Upload Files to Vector Store** :

* When you type "upload", the script will prompt you for file paths and upload these files to a vector store.

**Ask Questions About Uploaded Files** :

* After uploading the files, you can ask questions about the content of these files, and the assistant will search the vector store for relevant information to answer your questions.

**Vector Store Location** :

* The vector store is managed by the OpenAI API. You don't need to worry about its physical location; you just need to ensure that the files are uploaded and indexed correctly.

#### Streaming Helpers

The SDK also includes helpers to process streams and handle incoming events.

OpenAI supports streaming responses when interacting with the [Assistant](#assistant-streaming-api) APIs.

##### 🔄 **Explanation:**

You can stream responses from the AI, which means you get parts of the response as they come in, instead of waiting for the whole thing. It's like watching a YouTube video as it loads rather than waiting for the entire video to download first. In this code:

1. You start a "stream" of information from the AI.
2. You give some instructions to the AI (like how to address the user).
3. As the AI generates its response, you get pieces of it one at a time.
4. You can process or display these pieces as they arrive, making the interaction feel more real-time and responsive.

This is particularly useful for long responses or when you want to show progress to the user while the AI is thinking.

```python
with client.beta.threads.runs.stream(
    thread_id=thread.id,
    assistant_id=assistant.id,
    instructions="Please address the user as Jane Doe. The user has a premium account.",
) as stream:
    for event in stream:
        # Print the text from text delta events
        if event.type == "thread.message.delta" and event.data.delta.content:
            print(event.data.delta.content[0].text)
```

More information on streaming helpers can be found in the dedicated documentation: [helpers.md](helpers.md)

##### Assistant Streaming API

OpenAI supports streaming responses from Assistants. The SDK provides convenience wrappers around the API
so you can subscribe to the types of events you are interested in as well as receive accumulated responses.

More information can be found in the documentation: [Assistant Streaming](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview?lang=python)

##### An example of creating a run and subscribing to some events

You can subscribe to events by creating an event handler class and overloading the relevant event handlers.

```python
from typing_extensions import override
from openai import AssistantEventHandler, OpenAI
from openai.types.beta.threads import Text, TextDelta
from openai.types.beta.threads.runs import ToolCall, ToolCallDelta

client = openai.OpenAI()

# First, we create a EventHandler class to define
# how we want to handle the events in the response stream.

class EventHandler(AssistantEventHandler):
  @override
  def on_text_created(self, text: Text) -> None:
    print(f"\nassistant > ", end="", flush=True)

  @override
  def on_text_delta(self, delta: TextDelta, snapshot: Text):
    print(delta.value, end="", flush=True)

  @override
  def on_tool_call_created(self, tool_call: ToolCall):
    print(f"\nassistant > {tool_call.type}\n", flush=True)

  @override
  def on_tool_call_delta(self, delta: ToolCallDelta, snapshot: ToolCall):
    if delta.type == "code_interpreter" and delta.code_interpreter:
      if delta.code_interpreter.input:
        print(delta.code_interpreter.input, end="", flush=True)
      if delta.code_interpreter.outputs:
        print(f"\n\noutput >", flush=True)
        for output in delta.code_interpreter.outputs:
          if output.type == "logs":
            print(f"\n{output.logs}", flush=True)

# Then, we use the `stream` SDK helper
# with the `EventHandler` class to create the Run
# and stream the response.

with client.beta.threads.runs.stream(
  thread_id="thread_id",
  assistant_id="assistant_id",
  event_handler=EventHandler(),
) as stream:
  stream.until_done()
```

##### Full working example of Streaming Helpers

1. Create a file called chat.py
2. Copy and Paste the code below into the file, make sure the file is in the same folder as the .env file.
3. This script will import the keys from the .env file so you can continue your conversation due to having a vector database made to converse with.
4. Functionality between the synchronous and asynchronous clients is otherwise identical.
5. Run the script.
6. ```
   python chat.py

            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Async usage

Simply import `AsyncOpenAI` instead of `OpenAI` and use `await` with each API call:

```python
import os
import asyncio
from openai import AsyncOpenAI

client = AsyncOpenAI(
    # This is the default and can be omitted
    api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
)


async def main() -> None:
    chat_completion = await client.chat.completions.create(
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Say this is a test",
            }
        ],
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    )


asyncio.run(main())
```

Functionality between the synchronous and asynchronous clients is otherwise identical.

##### 🔄 **Explanation:**

You can use the library with [asynchronous](#asynchronous) code, which lets your program do other things while waiting for the AI to respond. It's like cooking several dishes at once instead of one after the other. Here's what's happening:

1. You import a special version of the OpenAI client that works asynchronously.
2. You define a function (`main()`) that uses `await` to talk to the AI.
3. This allows your program to do other tasks while it's waiting for the AI's response.
4. Finally, you run this async function using `asyncio.run(main())`.

This is particularly useful in applications that need to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, like web servers or interactive applications.

#### Streaming responses

We provide support for streaming responses using [Server Side Events (SSE)](#sse).

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

stream = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test"}],
    stream=True,
)
for chunk in stream:
    print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content or "", end="")
```

##### 🔄 **Explanation:**

Streaming responses allow you to get and process the AI's reply piece by piece, as it's being generated. It's like reading a book as it's being written, page by page, instead of waiting for the entire book to be finished. This code:

1. Sets up a streaming connection to the AI.
2. Asks the AI to say "this is a test".
3. As the AI generates its response, it sends back small "chunks" of text.
4. The code prints out each chunk as it arrives, creating a smooth, flowing output.

This is great for creating more responsive and interactive applications, especially when dealing with longer AI responses.

#### The async client uses the exact same interface.

```python
from openai import AsyncOpenAI

client = AsyncOpenAI()


async def main():
    stream = await client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test"}],
        stream=True,
    )
    async for chunk in stream:
        print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content or "", end="")


asyncio.run(main())
```

### Module-level client

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We highly recommend instantiating client instances instead of relying on the global client.

We also expose a global client instance that is accessible in a similar fashion to versions prior to v1.

```py
import openai

# optional; defaults to `os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']`
openai.api_key = '...'

# all client options can be configured just like the `OpenAI` instantiation counterpart
openai.base_url = "https://..."
openai.default_headers = {"x-foo": "true"}

completion = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "How do I output all files in a directory using Python?",
        },
    ],
)
print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

The API is the exact same as the standard client instance-based API.

This is intended to be used within REPLs or notebooks for faster iteration, **not** in application code.

We recommend that you always instantiate a client (e.g., with `client = OpenAI()`) in application code because:

- It can be difficult to reason about where client options are configured
- It's not possible to change certain client options without potentially causing race conditions
- It's harder to mock for testing purposes
- It's not possible to control cleanup of network connections

##### 🔧 **Explanation:**

This section talks about a global client, which is like having a universal remote that works for all your devices. However, just like a universal remote might not have all the special features for each specific device, using a global client isn't always the best choice for complex programs. Here's what's happening:

1. You set up a global OpenAI client that can be used anywhere in your code.
2. You can configure various options for this client, like the API key and default settings.
3. You can then use this client to interact with the AI, like asking it how to list files in a directory.

While this method is simple and can be useful for quick experiments or small scripts, for larger projects, it's better to create specific client instances for different parts of your program. This gives you more control and makes your code easier to manage and test.

Typed requests and responses provide autocomplete and documentation within your editor. If you would like to see type errors in VS Code to help catch bugs earlier, set `python.analysis.typeCheckingMode` to `basic`.

### Using Types

Nested request parameters are [TypedDicts](#typeddict). Responses are [Pydantic models](https://docs.pydantic.dev) which also provide helper methods for things like:

- Serializing back into [JSON](#json), `model.to_json()`
- Converting to a dictionary, `model.to_dict()`

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Can you generate an example json object describing a fruit?",
        }
    ],
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo-1106",
    response_format={"type": "json_object"},
)
```

##### 🛠️ **Explanation:**

The library uses typed requests and responses, which means it can help you catch mistakes while you write your code. Think of it as having a spell-checker for your programming instructions. Here's what this means:

1. When you send requests to the AI, you use special Python dictionaries ([TypedDicts](#typeddict)) that help ensure you're providing the right kind of information.
2. When you get responses back, they come as Pydantic models, which are like smart containers for data.
3. These models have helpful methods, like turning the data back into JSON or into a regular Python dictionary.

In the example, we're asking the AI to create a [JSON object](#json-object) describing a fruit. The library ensures we're formatting our request correctly and helps us work with the response easily. This type system acts like a safety net, catching potential errors before they cause problems in your program.

### Pagination

List methods in the OpenAI API are paginated.

This library provides auto-paginating iterators with each list response, so you do not have to request successive pages manually:

```python
import openai

client = OpenAI()

all_jobs = []
# Automatically fetches more pages as needed.
for job in client.fine_tuning.jobs.list(
    limit=20,
):
    # Do something with job here
    all_jobs.append(job)
print(all_jobs)
```

##### 🚀 **Explanation**:

Imagine you're reading a really long book, but instead of giving you the whole book at once, the library gives you 20 pages at a time. This code is like a magical bookmark that automatically gets the next 20 pages for you when you finish reading the current ones. You don't have to worry about asking for the next part - it just happens! In this case, instead of pages, we're getting information about AI training jobs, 20 at a time.

Or, asynchronously:

```python
import asyncio
import openai

client = AsyncOpenAI()


async def main() -> None:
    all_jobs = []
    # Iterate through items across all pages, issuing requests as needed.
    async for job in client.fine_tuning.jobs.list(
        limit=20,
    ):
        all_jobs.append(job)
    print(all_jobs)


asyncio.run(main())
```

##### 🏃‍♂️ **Explanation**:

This is like the previous example, but it's even cooler! Imagine you're in a relay race where you can start the next runner before the current one finishes. This code does something similar - it starts getting the next batch of information while it's still processing the current one. It's a way to make things happen faster, especially when you're dealing with lots of data.

Alternatively, you can use the `.has_next_page()`, `.next_page_info()`, or `.get_next_page()` methods for more granular control working with pages:

```python
first_page = await client.fine_tuning.jobs.list(
    limit=20,
)
if first_page.has_next_page():
    print(f"will fetch next page using these details: {first_page.next_page_info()}")
    next_page = await first_page.get_next_page()
    print(f"number of items we just fetched: {len(next_page.data)}")

# Remove `await` for non-async usage.
```

Or just work directly with the returned data:

```python
first_page = await client.fine_tuning.jobs.list(
    limit=20,
)

print(f"next page cursor: {first_page.after}")  # => "next page cursor: ..."
for job in first_page.data:
    print(job.id)

# Remove `await` for non-async usage.
```

##### **📂 Explanation:**

This is like getting a page of a book and a bookmark that shows where the next page starts. You can look at all the information on the current page (printing each job's ID), and you also know where to start reading next (the "next page cursor"). It's a way to keep track of where you are in all the information, just like how you might use a bookmark to remember your place in a big book.

Some API responses are too large to send all at once, so they are split into pages. The library can automatically handle fetching these pages for you. It's like getting a long book in several smaller, manageable volumes instead of one big, heavy book. Here's how it works:

1. You start a request to list something, like jobs for fine-tuning AI models.
2. You set a limit (in this case, 20) for how many items you want per page.
3. The library automatically fetches new pages as you go through the list.
4. You can process each item (job) as it comes in, without worrying about the pagination.

This makes it much easier to work with large amounts of data, as you don't have to manually keep track of which page you're on or when to request the next page. The library handles all of that for you behind the scenes.

### Nested params

Nested parameters are dictionaries, typed using `TypedDict`, for example:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Can you generate an example json object describing a fruit?",
        }
    ],
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo-1106",
    response_format={"type": "json_object"},
)
```

##### 🔄 **Explanation:**

Nested parameters allow you to organize complex information in a structured way, like having folders inside folders on your computer. Here's what's happening in this code:

1. We create an OpenAI [client](#client) to communicate with the AI.
2. We use the [chat.completions.create](#chat-completions-create) method to generate a response.
3. The `messages` parameter is a list containing a dictionary. This dictionary has two nested key-value pairs: "role" and "content".
4. We specify the AI model to use with the `model` parameter.
5. The [response_format](#response-format) parameter is another nested dictionary, telling the AI to respond with a [JSON object](#json-object).

This nested structure allows us to provide detailed and organized instructions to the AI. In this case, we're asking it to generate a [JSON](#json) object describing a fruit. The use of [TypedDict](#typeddict) helps ensure that we're formatting these nested parameters correctly, reducing the chance of errors in our code.

### File uploads

Request parameters that correspond to file uploads can be passed as `bytes`, a [`PathLike`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.PathLike) instance or a tuple of `(filename, contents, media type)`.

```python
from pathlib import Path
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

client.files.create(
    file=Path("input.jsonl"),
    purpose="fine-tune",
)
```

##### 🔧 **Explanation:**

The async client uses the exact same interface. If you pass a [`PathLike`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.PathLike) instance, the file contents will be read asynchronously automatically.

You can upload files directly to the API, which can be used for things like fine-tuning models. It's like uploading a document to a website so that the site can use the information in the document. In this example:

1. We import the `Path` class to work with file paths easily.
2. We create an OpenAI client.
3. We use the `files.create` method to upload a file.
4. We specify the file path and its purpose (in this case, for fine-tuning a model).

This is useful when you need to provide large amounts of data to the AI, such as training data for customizing models.

## Handling errors

When the library is unable to connect to the API (for example, due to network connection problems or a timeout), a subclass of `openai.APIConnectionError` is raised.

When the API returns a non-success status code (that is, 4xx or 5xx
response), a subclass of `openai.APIStatusError` is raised, containing `status_code` and `response` properties.

All errors inherit from `openai.APIError`.

```python
import openai
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

try:
    client.fine_tuning.jobs.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        training_file="file-abc123",
    )
except openai.APIConnectionError as e:
    print("The server could not be reached")
    print(e.__cause__)  # an underlying Exception, likely raised within httpx.
except openai.RateLimitError as e:
    print("A 429 status code was received; we should back off a bit.")
except openai.APIStatusError as e:
    print("Another non-200-range status code was received")
    print(e.status_code)
    print(e.response)
```

Error codes are as followed:

| Status Code | Error Type                   |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| 400         | `BadRequestError`          |
| 401         | `AuthenticationError`      |
| 403         | `PermissionDeniedError`    |
| 404         | `NotFoundError`            |
| 422         | `UnprocessableEntityError` |
| 429         | `RateLimitError`           |
| >=500       | `InternalServerError`      |
| N/A         | `APIConnectionError`       |

##### ⚠️ **Explanation:**

The library provides error handling for different types of errors that can occur while interacting with the API. It's like having a plan for what to do if something goes wrong while you're working on a project. Here's what's happening:

1. We set up a try-except block to catch different types of errors.
2. We attempt to create a fine-tuning job.
3. If there's a connection error, we catch it and print a message.
4. If we hit a rate limit (too many requests), we catch that specific error.
5. For any other API errors, we catch them and print details about the error.

This error handling helps you write more robust code that can gracefully handle problems when they occur, rather than crashing unexpectedly.

### Retries

Certain errors are automatically retried 2 times by default, with a short exponential backoff.
Connection errors (for example, due to a network connectivity problem), 408 Request Timeout, 409 Conflict,
429 Rate Limit, and >=500 Internal errors are all retried by default.

You can use the `max_retries` option to configure or disable retry settings:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

# Configure the default for all requests:
client = OpenAI(
    # default is 2
    max_retries=0,
)

# Or, configure per-request:
client.with_options(max_retries=5).chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "How can I get the name of the current day in Node.js?",
        }
    ],
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
)
```

#### 🔁 **Explanation:**

Some errors are automatically retried by the library. You can configure how many times to retry or disable retries. It's like trying to reconnect your WiFi if it drops the first time. Here's what this code does:

1. We can set a default number of retries for all requests when creating the client.
2. We can also set the number of retries for a specific request using `with_options()`.
3. If an error occurs that's eligible for retry, the library will automatically try again up to the specified number of times.

This feature helps make your application more resilient to temporary network issues or server problems.

### Timeouts

By default requests time out after 10 minutes. You can configure this with a `timeout` option,
which accepts a float or an [`httpx.Timeout`](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/#fine-tuning-the-configuration) object:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

# Configure the default for all requests:
client = OpenAI(
    # 20 seconds (default is 10 minutes)
    timeout=20.0,
)

# More granular control:
client = OpenAI(
    timeout=httpx.Timeout(60.0, read=5.0, write=10.0, connect=2.0),
)

# Override per-request:
client.with_options(timeout=5.0).chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "How can I list all files in a directory using Python?",
        }
    ],
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
)
```

On timeout, an `APITimeoutError` is thrown.

Note that requests that time out are [retried twice by default](#retries).

##### ⏲️ **Explanation:**

You can set how long to wait for a response before timing out. It's like setting a timer for how long you'll wait for a friend before leaving. Here's what's happening:

1. We can set a default timeout for all requests when creating the client.
2. We can also set a timeout for a specific request using `with_options()`.
3. If the API doesn't respond within the specified time, the request will be cancelled and an error will be raised.

This helps prevent your application from hanging indefinitely if there's a problem with the API or network.

## Advanced

### Logging

We use the standard library [`logging`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) module.

You can enable logging by setting the environment variable `OPENAI_LOG` to `debug`.

```shell
$ export OPENAI_LOG=debug
```

##### 📜 **Explanation:**

Logging helps you see what's happening behind the scenes in your application. It's like having a detective's notebook that records everything that happens. By setting the `OPENAI_LOG` environment variable to `debug`, you're telling the library to write detailed information about its operations, which can be very helpful for troubleshooting problems.

### How to tell whether `None` means `null` or missing

In an API response, a field may be explicitly `null`, or missing entirely; in either case, its value is `None` in this library. You can differentiate the two cases with `.model_fields_set`:

```py
if response.my_field is None:
  if 'my_field' not in response.model_fields_set:
    print('Got json like {}, without a "my_field" key present at all.')
  else:
    print('Got json like {"my_field": null}.')
```

### Accessing raw response data (e.g. headers)

The "raw" Response object can be accessed by prefixing `.with_raw_response.` to any HTTP method call, e.g.,

```py
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()
response = client.chat.completions.with_raw_response.create(
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Say this is a test",
    }],
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
)
print(response.headers.get('X-My-Header'))

completion = response.parse()  # get the object that `chat.completions.create()` would have returned
print(completion)
```

##### 🔧 **Explanation:**

These methods return an [`LegacyAPIResponse`](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/tree/main/src/openai/_legacy_response.py) object. This is a legacy class as we're changing it slightly in the next major version.

For the sync client this will mostly be the same with the exception
of `content` & `text` will be methods instead of properties. In the
async client, all methods will be async.

A migration script will be provided & the migration in general should
be smooth.

#### `.with_streaming_response`

The above interface eagerly reads the full response body when you make the request, which may not always be what you want.

To stream the response body, use `.with_streaming_response` instead, which requires a context manager and only reads the response body once you call `.read()`, `.text()`, `.json()`, `.iter_bytes()`, `.iter_text()`, `.iter_lines()` or `.parse()`. In the async client, these are async methods.

As such, `.with_streaming_response` methods return a different [`APIResponse`](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/tree/main/src/openai/_response.py) object, and the async client returns an [`AsyncAPIResponse`](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/tree/main/src/openai/_response.py) object.

```python
with client.chat.completions.with_streaming_response.create(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Say this is a test",
        }
    ],
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
) as response:
    print(response.headers.get("X-My-Header"))

    for line in response.iter_lines():
        print(line)
```

The context manager is required so that the response will reliably be closed.

### Making custom/undocumented requests

This library is typed for convenient access to the documented API.

If you need to access undocumented endpoints, params, or response properties, the library can still be used.

#### Undocumented endpoints

To make requests to undocumented endpoints, you can make requests using `client.get`, `client.post`, and other
http verbs. Options on the client will be respected (such as retries) will be respected when making this
request.

```py
import httpx

response = client.post(
    "/foo",
    cast_to=httpx.Response,
    body={"my_param": True},
)

print(response.headers.get("x-foo"))
```

#### Undocumented request params

If you want to explicitly send an extra param, you can do so with the `extra_query`, `extra_body`, and `extra_headers` request
options.

#### Undocumented response properties

To access undocumented response properties, you can access the extra fields like `response.unknown_prop`. You
can also get all the extra fields on the Pydantic model as a dict with
[`response.model_extra`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/base_model/#pydantic.BaseModel.model_extra).

### Configuring the HTTP client

You can directly override the [httpx client](https://www.python-httpx.org/api/#client) to customize it for your use case, including:

- Support for proxies
- Custom transports
- Additional [advanced](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/clients/) functionality

```python
from openai import OpenAI, DefaultHttpxClient

client = OpenAI(
    # Or use the `OPENAI_BASE_URL` env var
    base_url="http://my.test.server.example.com:8083",
    http_client=DefaultHttpxClient(
        proxies="http://my.test.proxy.example.com",
        transport=httpx.HTTPTransport(local_address="0.0.0.0"),
    ),
)
```

### Managing HTTP resources

By default the library closes underlying HTTP connections whenever the client is [garbage collected](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__del__). You can manually close the client using the `.close()` method if desired, or with a context manager that closes when exiting.

## Microsoft Azure OpenAI

To use this library with [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/overview), use the `AzureOpenAI`
class instead of the `OpenAI` class.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Azure API shape differs from the core API shape which means that the static types for responses / params
> won't always be correct.

```py
from openai import AzureOpenAI

# gets the API Key from environment variable AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY
client = AzureOpenAI(
    # https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/reference#rest-api-versioning
    api_version="2023-07-01-preview",
    # https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal#create-a-resource
    azure_endpoint="https://example-endpoint.openai.azure.com",
)

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="deployment-name",  # e.g. gpt-35-instant
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "How do I output all files in a directory using Python?",
        },
    ],
)
print(completion.to_json())
```

In addition to the options provided in the base `OpenAI` client, the following options are provided:

- `azure_endpoint` (or the `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` environment variable)
- `azure_deployment`
- `api_version` (or the `OPENAI_API_VERSION` environment variable)
- `azure_ad_token` (or the `AZURE_OPENAI_AD_TOKEN` environment variable)
- `azure_ad_token_provider`

An example of using the client with Microsoft Entra ID (formerly known as Azure Active Directory) can be found [here](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/examples/azure_ad.py).

##### 🔧 **Explanation:**

If you are using OpenAI through Microsoft Azure, you need to use the AzureOpenAI class. It's like using a different key to unlock the same door. Here's what's happening:

1. We import the `AzureOpenAI` class instead of the regular `OpenAI` class.
2. We create a client with Azure-specific parameters like `api_version` and `azure_endpoint`.
3. We can then use this client to interact with the AI in the same way as before.

This allows you to use OpenAI's capabilities through Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, which might be preferred for certain business or integration reasons.

## Versioning

This package generally follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) conventions, though certain backwards-incompatible changes may be released as minor versions:

1. Changes that only affect static types, without breaking runtime behavior.
2. Changes to library internals which are technically public but not intended or documented for external use. _(Please open a GitHub issue to let us know if you are relying on such internals)_.
3. Changes that we do not expect to impact the vast majority of users in practice.

We take backwards-compatibility seriously and work hard to ensure you can rely on a smooth upgrade experience.

We are keen for your feedback; please open an [issue](https://www.github.com/openai/openai-python/issues) with questions, bugs, or suggestions.

##### 🔄 **Explanation:**

The library follows versioning rules to ensure backward compatibility. It's like updating an app on your phone to get new features without breaking the old ones. The developers try to make sure that when they release new versions:

1. Your existing code will still work (backwards-compatibility).
2. You know what to expect from each update (following SemVer conventions).
3. You have a way to give feedback or report problems (through GitHub issues).

This helps you keep your projects up-to-date while minimizing the risk of unexpected breaks in your code.

### Requirements

1. **Python 3.7 or higher** : The OpenAI Python library requires Python version 3.7 or higher. This ensures compatibility with the latest features and security updates of the Python language.
2. **Internet Access** : Since the OpenAI API communicates with OpenAI's servers over the internet, you'll need an internet connection to make API requests and receive responses.
3. **OpenAI API Key** : To use the OpenAI API, you'll need an API key, which you can obtain by signing up for an account on the OpenAI platform. This key is used to authenticate your requests.
4. **pip (Python package installer)** : You need pip to install the OpenAI Python library and its dependencies. Pip usually comes pre-installed with Python, but you can download it if needed.
5. **HTTP Client Library (httpx)** : The OpenAI Python library uses the httpx library to make HTTP requests. This library will be installed automatically when you install the OpenAI Python library using pip.
6. **Dependencies** : The library may require additional dependencies which will be installed automatically with the library. These dependencies include libraries necessary for making HTTP requests, handling JSON data, and other functionalities.
